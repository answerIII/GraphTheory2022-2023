756.py - You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top.

To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.

For example, "ABC" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from "BAC" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom.
You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.

Given bottom and allowed, return true if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular pattern in the pyramid is in allowed, or false otherwise.

1722.py - Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations
You are given two integer arrays, source and target, both of length n. You are also given an array allowedSwaps where each allowedSwaps[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index ai and index bi (0-indexed) of array source. Note that you can swap elements at a specific pair of indices multiple times and in any order.

The Hamming distance of two arrays of the same length, source and target, is the number of positions where the elements are different. Formally, it is the number of indices i for 0 <= i <= n-1 where source[i] != target[i] (0-indexed).

Return the minimum Hamming distance of source and target after performing any amount of swap operations on array source.

1376.py Time Needed to Inform All Employees
A company has n employees with a unique ID for each employee from 0 to n - 1. The head of the company is the one with headID.
Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where manager[i] is the direct manager of the i-th employee, manager[headID] = -1. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.
The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.
The i-th employee needs informTime[i] minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).
Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.
