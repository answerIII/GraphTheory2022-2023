# Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups
(https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-nodes-into-the-maximum-number-of-groups/)

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:

Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.

* For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y, then |y - x| = 1.
* Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.

## Example 1:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94119476/235192989-2db29b7e-0fdf-43df-933e-329ef3df08c8.png)

Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]

Output: 4

Explanation: As shown in the image we:
- Add node 5 to the first group.
- Add node 1 to the second group.
- Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
- Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
- 
We can see that every edge is satisfied.

It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from the third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.

## Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 500
* 1 <= edges.length <= 10^{4}
* edges[i].length == 2
* 1 <= ai, bi <= n
* ai != bi
* There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.
